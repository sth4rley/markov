#+TITLE: Markov Chain Text Generator
#+DESCRIPTION: A simple Markov Chain text generator in Python.

** Overview
This repository contains a simple Markov Chain text generator implemented in Python. The script reads input text, builds a probability table, and generates text based on the observed word sequences.

** Usage
To generate text, run the script with the desired output length:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python markov.py <100 zen.txt
#+END_SRC

Where ~zen.txt~ is a text file containing the source material, and ~100~ is the number of words to generate.

** Requirements
- Python 3
